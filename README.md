# MULTIPAC testbench
This library is designed to post-treat the data from the MULTIPAC multipactor test bench at LPSC, Grenoble, France.

## Installation

The steps are straightforward and can be summarized as follows:
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone git@github.com:AdrienPlacais/multipac_testbench.git`
2. Create a dedicated Python environment.
3. Navigate to the main `multipac_testbench` folder and install the library with all dependencies: `pip install -e .`

Note that you will need Python 3.11 or higher to use the library.

If you want to use `conda`, you must manually install the required packages defined in `pyproject.toml`.
Then, add `multipac_testbench.src` to your `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

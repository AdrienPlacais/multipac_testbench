This library offers simple methods to post-treat data from the MULTIPAC testbench.
Check :ref:`examples` for a quick tour of the available commands.

   Create a ``TestCampaign`` object.
   It would gather several :class:`.MultipactorTest` objects, with different ``SWR`` and/or ``f_mhz``.
   It would have a ``Sommersalo_plot`` and ``Hatch_diagram`` methods.
